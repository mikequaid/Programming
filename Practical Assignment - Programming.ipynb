    "## The purpose of numpy.random package\n",
    "\n",
    "The random module in Python's numpy package (note 1) is a tool which provides a suite of functions for generating random numbers, data and distributions. The module is comprised of \"simple random data\" (functions), \"permutations\", \"distributions\" and \"random generators. The module is also capable of generating a vast amount of probability distributions (note 2). It uses a particular algorithm, called the Mersenne Twister to generate pseudorandom numbers (note 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1 - Numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 2 - A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range.The most common probability distribution is the normal distribution, or \"bell curve\" [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 3 - The Mersenne Twister is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) and is the most widely used general-purpose PRNG.A PRNG also known as a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers [3].\n",
